I currently work as a software engineer at [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/nl_nl/) in the Search Product Unit. 

Before that I worked at [Turkcell](https://www.turkcell.com.tr/) between March, 2020 and August, 2021 in the development of the search engine project [Yaani](https://www.yaani.com.tr/). I mostly worked on indexing and ranking there.

Before that, I was an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University and I was part of the [Center for Data-Intensive systems (DAISY)](https://www.daisy.aau.dk/). My research interests in general were querying in semantic web, spatial keyword querying and spatio-temporal data analysis. Prior to that I was a post-doctoral researcher working with [Katja Hose](https://homes.cs.aau.dk/~khose/About_me.html). I worked on querying knowledge graphs and evaluation of systems for querying knowledge graphs during my postdoc. I got my Ph.D. from the same department in May, 2018 under the supervision of [Christian S. Jensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_S._Jensen) and [Simonas Saltenis](https://homes.cs.aau.dk/~simas/). During my PhD studies, I worked on the evaluation of ranking functions used for spatial keyword queries. I have developed methods to obtain user preferences via crowdsourcing and GPS trajectories. In addition to that I worked on processing spatial keyword clusters queries.

Prior to joining to DAISY, I was a research assistant at the Department of Computer Engineering, Middle East Technical University (METU) for 3 years (2011 - 2014). I was part of the team of system administrators and our team was responsible for administration and maintenance of the department servers. I completed my masters in computer engineering under the supervision of [Ismail Hakki Toroslu](https://avesis.metu.edu.tr/toroslu) at the same department in 2014. My thesis was the result of a SANTEZ (University Industry Collaboration Project) project with AVEA (one of the largest mobile phone operators in Turkey) and the title of the project was "Predicting Location of Mobile Phone Users". I also completed my BSc in computer engineering at METU in 2011.
